We visited quite a lot of places but after a while we started to realize that there wasn't anything fun or new or even interesting on Earth. Why do people keep going on about how amazing life is on Earth? And how much the earthlings have progressed in life?\nWe found nothing worth noting on Earth. The technology was far inferior to ours, the entertainment facilities were an even bigger disappointment. Unfortunately, we were kinda stuck here until our tour ship came back to get us. Considering that we are the most advanced species in the galaxy, it was basically a torture to make do with the entertainment available for us. As we all know, getting bored might sometimes get quite lethal for us and we were on the verge of a break down. Just as we were losing hope, one of our companion pointed something out, a way for us to survive this boredom. People watching. \nAnyways, we managed to get by. Just barely. One thing is for sure, I would never recommend Earth to anyone. Ever. Cause I wouldn't wish that kind of boredom on anyone.",
